Auction Bidding App

https://github.com/talhashahab786/Auction.git

        1.1. Purpose of Document:
The purpose of this mobile application is to solve the problem (currently in Pakistan) of going to different places for bidding any certain product. Moreover, it also solves the problem of overpaying and underpayment of certain products. In today’s time, people are selling and buying different products online and because people do not find appropriate customer they are forced to sell their product at a low cost.
If this Auction application is developed it will give option to every buyer to bid the price higher or bid the price lower according to the product so that the buyer could get the product at an appropriate price, and through the machine learning algorithm our app will predict the price of the product so that user can get the idea of whether the asked price from seller is legitimate or if it is higher so that the buyer can bid the price accordingly.

        1.2. Intended Audience:
The users of this app would be sellers of products who have already used their product and the buyers who want to purchase the product using bidding. The app is for those customers who want to purchase product at appropriate and reasonable prices just according to the market value. Price suggestion feature will greatly assist in that. Furthermore, one can purchase electronic devices such as mobile phones, electronic machine such as refrigerators, houses and flat portions of any area as well as vehicles etc. can all be bought via the use of the app through bidding.
